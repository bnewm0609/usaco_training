<p id="id_0077412346_001_004268">Two very different conflicts were taking shape in the last years of Jefferson's presidency. One was the continuing tension in Europe, which in 1803 escalated once again into a full-scale conflict (the Napoleonic Wars). As fighting between the British and the French increased, each side took steps to prevent the United States from trading with the other. The other conflict occurred in North America itself, a result of the ceaseless westward expansion of white settlement, which was colliding with a native population committed to protecting its lands from intruders. In both the North and the South, the threatened tribes mobilized to resist white encroachments. They began as well to forge connections with British forces in Canada and Spanish forces in Florida. The Indian conflict on land, therefore, became intertwined with the European conflict on the seas, and ultimately helped cause the War of 1812.</p>
</div><div class="subsection" id="id_0077412346_001_004269"><span class="sectitle bhead" id="id_0077412346_001_004270">C<span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="smallcaps">onflict on the</span> S<span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="smallcaps">eas</span></span>
<p id="id_0077412346_001_004271">In 1805, at the Battle of Trafalgar, a British fleet virtually destroyed what was left of the French navy. Because France could no longer challenge the British at sea, Napoleon now chose to pressure England in other ways. The result was what he called the Continental System, designed to close the European continent to British trade. Napoleon issued a series of decrees barring British ships and neutral ships touching at British ports from landing their cargoes at any European port controlled by France or its allies. The British government replied to Napoleon's decrees by establishing a blockade of the European coast. The blockade required that any goods being shipped to Napoleon's Europe be carried either in British vessels or in neutral vessels stopping at British ports—precisely what Napoleon's policies forbade.</p>
<div class="newpageo" id="PG_172"><div class="newpage">Page 172</div></div><p id="id_0077412346_001_004272">In the early nineteenth century, the United States had developed one of the most important merchant marines in the world, one that soon controlled a large proportion of the trade between Europe and the West Indies. But the events in Europe now challenged that control, because American ships were caught between Napoleon's decrees and Britain's blockade. If they sailed directly for the European continent, they risked being captured by the British navy. If they sailed by way of a British port, they ran the risk of seizure by the French. Both of the warring powers were violating America's rights as a neutral nation. But most Americans considered the British, with their greater sea power, the worse offender—especially since British vessels frequently stopped American ships on the high seas and seized sailors off the decks, making them victims of “impressment.”</p>
</div><div class="subsection" id="id_0077412346_001_004273"><span class="sectitle bhead" id="id_0077412346_001_004274">I<span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="smallcaps">mpressment</span></span>
<p id="id_0077412346_001_004275">Many British sailors called their navy—with its floggings, its low pay, and its terrible shipboard conditions—a “floating hell.” Few volunteered. Most had had to be “impressed” (forced) into the service, and at every opportunity they deserted. By 1807, many of these deserters had emigrated to the United States and joined the American merchant marine or American navy. To check this loss of manpower, the British claimed the right to stop and search American merchantmen and reimpress deserters. They did not claim the right to take native-born Americans, but they did insist on the right to seize naturalized Americans born on British soil. In practice, the British navy often made no careful distinctions, impressing British deserters and native-born Americans alike.</p>
<p id="id_0077412346_001_004276">In the summer of 1807, the British went to more provocative extremes. Sailing from Norfolk, with several alleged deserters from the British navy among the crew, the American naval frigate <i>Chesapeake</i> was hailed by the British ship <i>Leopard.</i> When the American commander, James Barron, refused to allow the British to search the <i>Chesapeake,</i> the <i>Leopard</i> opened fire. Barron had no choice but to surrender, and a boarding party from the <i>Leopard</i> dragged four men off the American frigate.</p>
<p id="id_0077412346_001_004277">When news of the <i>Chesapeake-Leopard</i> incident reached the United States, there was a great popular clamor for revenge. Jefferson and Madison tried to maintain the peace. Jefferson expelled all British warships from American waters to lessen the likelihood of future incidents. Then he sent instructions to his minister in England, James Monroe, to demand from the British government an end to impressment. The British government disavowed the actions of the <i>Leopard's</i> commanding officer and recalled him; it offered compensation for those killed and wounded in the incident; and it promised to return three of the captured sailors (one of the original four had been hanged). But the British cabinet refused to renounce impressment and instead reasserted its right to recover deserting seamen.</p>
</div><div class="subsection" id="id_0077412346_001_004278"><span class="sectitle bhead" id="id_0077412346_001_004279">“P<span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="smallcaps">eaceable</span> C<span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="smallcaps">oercion</span>”</span>
<p id="id_0077412346_001_004280">In an effort to prevent future incidents that might bring the nation again to the brink of war, Jefferson persuaded Congress to pass a drastic measure late in 1807. It was known as the Embargo, and it prohibited American ships from leaving the United States for any foreign port anywhere in the world. The law was widely evaded, but it was effective enough to create a serious depression throughout most of the nation. Hardest hit were the merchants and shipowners of the Northeast, most of them Federalists.</p>
<div class="newpageo" id="PG_173"><div class="newpage">Page 173</div></div><p id="id_0077412346_001_004281">The presidential election of 1808 came in the midst of this Embargo-induced depression. James Madison was elected president, but the Federalist candidate, Charles Pinckney again, ran much more strongly than he had in 1804. The Embargo was clearly a growing political liability, and Jefferson decided to back down. A few days before leaving office, he approved a bill ending his experiment with what he called “peaceable coercion.”</p>
<p id="id_0077412346_001_004282">To replace the Embargo, Congress passed the Non-Intercourse Act just before Madison took office. It reopened trade with all nations but Great Britain and France. A year later, in 1810, the Non-Intercourse Act expired and was replaced by Macon's Bill No. 2, which reopened free commercial relations with Britain and France but authorized the president to prohibit commerce with either belligerent if it should continue violating neutral shipping after the other had stopped. Napoleon, in an effort to induce the United States to reimpose the Embargo against Britain, announced that France would no longer interfere with American shipping. Madison announced that an embargo against Great Britain alone would automatically go into effect early in 1811 unless Britain renounced its restrictions on American shipping.</p>
<p id="id_0077412346_001_004283">In time, this new, limited embargo persuaded England to repeal its blockade of Europe. But the repeal came too late to prevent war. In any case, naval policies were only part of the reason for tensions between Britain and the United States.</p>
</div><div class="subsection" id="id_0077412346_001_004284"><span class="sectitle bhead" id="id_0077412346_001_004285">T<span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="smallcaps">he</span> “I<span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="smallcaps">ndian</span> P<span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="smallcaps">roblem</span>” <span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="smallcaps">and the</span> B<span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="smallcaps">ritish</span></span>
<p id="id_0077412346_001_004286">Given the ruthlessness with which white settlers in North America had continued to dislodge Indian tribes, it was hardly surprising that Indians continued to look to England for protection. The British in Canada, for their part, had relied on the Indians as partners in the lucrative fur trade. There had been relative peace in the Northwest for over a decade after Jay's Treaty and Anthony Wayne's victory over the tribes at Fallen Timbers in 1794. But the 1807 war crisis following the <i>Chesapeake-Leopard</i> incident revived the conflict between Indians and white settlers.</p>
<p id="id_0077412346_001_004287">The Virginia-born William Henry Harrison, already a veteran Indian fighter at age twenty-six, went to Washington as the congressional delegate from the Northwest Territory in 1799. An advocate of development in the western lands, he was largely responsible for the passage in 1800 of the so-called Harrison Land Law, which enabled white settlers to acquire farms from the public domain on much easier terms than before.</p>
<p id="id_0077412346_001_004288">In 1801, Jefferson appointed Harrison governor of the Indiana Territory to administer the president's proposed solution to the “Indian problem.” Jefferson offered the Indians a choice: they could convert themselves into settled farmers and become a part of white society, or they could migrate west of the Mississippi. In either case, they would have to give up their claims to their tribal lands in the Northwest.</p>
<p id="id_0077412346_001_004289">Jefferson considered the assimilation policy a benign alternative to the continuing conflict between Indians and white settlers. But to the tribes, the new policy seemed far from benign, especially given the bludgeonlike efficiency with which Harrison set out to implement it. He used threats, bribes, trickery, and whatever other tactics he felt would help him conclude treaties. In the first decade of the nineteenth century, the number of western Americans who had settled west of the Appalachians had grown to more than 500,000—a population far larger than that of the Native Americans. It was becoming almost inevitable, as a result, that the tribes would face ever-growing pressure to move out of the way of the rapidly growing white settlements.</p>
<p id="id_0077412346_001_004290">By 1807 the United States had extracted treaty rights to eastern Michigan, southern Indiana, and most of Illinois from reluctant tribal leaders.</p>
<div class="newpageo" id="PG_174"><div class="newpage">Page 174</div></div><p id="id_0077412346_001_004291">Meanwhile, in the Southwest, white Americans were taking millions of acres from other tribes in Georgia, Tennessee, and Mississippi. The Indians wanted desperately to resist, but the separate tribes were helpless by themselves against the power of the United States. They might have accepted their fate passively but for the emergence of two new factors.</p>
<p id="id_0077412346_001_004292">One factor was the policy of British authorities in Canada. After the <i>Chesapeake</i> incident, they began to expect an American invasion of Canada and took desperate measures for their own defense. Among those measures were efforts to renew friendship with the Indians.</p>
</div><div class="subsection" id="id_0077412346_001_004293"><span class="sectitle bhead" id="id_0077412346_001_004294">T<span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="smallcaps">ecumseh and the</span> P<span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="smallcaps">rophet</span></span>
<p id="id_0077412346_001_004295">A second, and more important, factor intensifying the border conflict was the rise of two remarkable native leaders. One was Tenskwatawa, a charismatic religious leader and orator known as “the Prophet.” Like Handsome Lake, he had experienced a mystical awakening in the process of recovering from alcoholism. Having freed himself from what he considered the evil effects of white culture, he began to speak to his people of the superior virtues of Indian civilization and the sinfulness and corruption of the white world. In the process, he inspired a religious revival that spread through numerous tribes and helped unite them. The Prophet's headquarters at the meeting of Tippecanoe Creek and the Wabash River (known as Prophetstown) became a sacred place for people of many tribes. Out of their common religious experiences, they began to consider joint military efforts as well. Tenskwatawa advocated an Indian society entirely separate from that of white Americans and a culture rooted in tribal tradition. The effort to trade with the Anglos and to borrow from their culture would, he argued, lead to the death of Indian ways.</p>
<p id="id_0077412346_001_004296">Tecumseh—the chief of the Shawnees, called by his tribe “the Shooting Star”—was in many ways even more militant than his brother. “Where today are the Pequot,” he thundered. “Where are … the other powerful tribes of our people? They have vanished before the avarice and oppression of the white man.” And he warned of his tribe's extermination if they did not take action against the white Americans moving into their lands.</p>
<p id="id_0077412346_001_004297">Tecumseh understood, as few other Indian leaders had, that only through united action could the tribes hope to resist the steady advance of white civilization. Beginning in 1809, he set out to unite all the tribes of the Mississippi Valley into what became known as the Tecumseh Confederacy. Together, he promised, they would halt white expansion, recover the whole Northwest, and make the Ohio River the boundary between the United States and Indian country. He maintained that Harrison and others, by negotiating treaties with individual tribes, had obtained no real title to land. The land belonged to all the tribes; none of them could rightfully cede any of it without the consent of the others. In 1811, Tecumseh left Prophetstown and traveled down the Mississippi to visit the tribes of the South and persuade them to join the alliance.</p>
<p id="id_0077412346_001_004298">During Tecumseh's absence, Governor Harrison saw a chance to destroy the growing influence of the two Indian leaders. With 1,000 soldiers, he camped near Prophetstown, and on November 7, 1811, he provoked an armed conflict. Although the white forces suffered losses as heavy as those of the natives, Harrison drove off the Indians and burned the town. The Battle of Tippecanoe (named for the creek near which it was fought) disillusioned many of the Prophet's followers, and Tecumseh returned to find the confederacy in disarray. But there were still warriors eager for combat, and by spring of 1812 they were active along the frontier, raiding white settlements and terrifying settlers.</p>
<p id="id_0077412346_001_004299">The bloodshed along the western borders was largely a result of the Indians' own initiative, but Britain's agents in Canada had encouraged and helped to supply the uprising. To Harrison and most white residents of the regions, there seemed only one way to make the West safe for Americans: to drive the British out of Canada and annex that province to the United States.</p>
</div><div class="newpageo" id="PG_175"><div class="newpage">Page 175</div></div><div class="subsection" id="id_0077412346_001_004300"><span class="sectitle bhead" id="id_0077412346_001_004301">F<span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="smallcaps">lorida and</span> W<span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="smallcaps">ar</span> F<span style="font-variant: small-caps" class="smallcaps">ever</span></span>
<p id="id_0077412346_001_004302">While white frontiersmen in the North demanded the conquest of Canada, those in the South looked to the acquisition of Spanish Florida. The territory was a continuing threat to whites in the southern United States. Slaves escaped across the Florida border; Indians in Florida launched frequent raids north. But white southerners also coveted Florida because through it ran rivers that could provide residents of the Southwest with access to valuable ports on the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
<p id="id_0077412346_001_004303">In 1810, American settlers in West Florida (the area presently part of Mississippi and Louisiana) seized the Spanish fort at Baton Rouge and asked the federal government to annex the territory to the United States. President Madison happily agreed and then began planning to get the rest of Florida, too. The desire for Florida became yet another motivation for war with Britain. Spain was Britain's ally, and a war with England might provide an excuse for taking Spanish as well as British territory.</p>
<p id="id_0077412346_001_004304">By 1812, therefore, war fever was raging on both the northern and southern borders of the United States. The demands of the residents of these areas found substantial support in Washington among a group of determined young congressmen who soon earned the name “War Hawks.”</p>
<p id="id_0077412346_001_004305">In the congressional elections of 1810, voters elected a large number of representatives of both parties eager for war with Britain. The most influential of them came from the new states in the West or from the backcountry of the old states in the South. Two of their leaders, both recently elected to the House of Representatives, were Henry Clay of Kentucky and John C. Calhoun of South Carolina, men of great intellect, magnetism, and ambition. Both were supporters of war with Great Britain.</p>
<p id="id_0077412346_001_004306">Clay was elected Speaker of the House in 1811, and he appointed Calhoun to the crucial Committee on Foreign Affairs. Both men began agitating for the conquest of Canada. Madison still preferred peace but was losing control of Congress. On June 18, 1812, he approved a declaration of war against Britain.</p>
